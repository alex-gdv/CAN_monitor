# CAN Monitor

I developed this application as a software engineering intern at [Melford Technologies](https://www.melfordtechnologies.com/). 
From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus): 
"_A Controller Area Network (CAN bus) is a vehicle bus standard designed to allow microcontrollers and devices to communicate with each other's applications without a host computer._"
The Development Manager wanted an application to test and monitor messages being sent through CAN buses between hardware devices.
Hence, I developed this application in Visual Studio and C#.
